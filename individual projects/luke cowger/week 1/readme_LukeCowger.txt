This Simulink model models a car traveling around a track that is no longer flat. The height of the track is dependent on a function given to us. I used that function and its derivative to determine the slope at any point on the track. The function (x-450) was reversed to (450-x) as this is the function of the height on the top straightaway. The slope is labeled as the grade, which is fed into the vehicle dynamics, as it is going to change the speed of the car and the power/torque needed. To run this model, open up all of the files and run the p4_runsim.m file.
