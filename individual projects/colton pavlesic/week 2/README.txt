This week, I completed my individual submission requirements of adding grade to the track profile. This was done in the environment subsystem. I took the derivative of the provided height function to get slope. Then the position of the vehicle is used in conjunction with the slope function to compute the grade. Positive grade for going uphill and negative grade for going downhill.

Instructions to run:
Open the following matlab and Simulink files
- gentrack.m
- p4_init.m
- p4_runsim.m
- raceStat.m
- rotate.m
- computeDeviation.m
- p4_car_colton_update1.slx

To run the simulation, run the p4_init.m script, then run the p4_runsim.m script. Wait for the simulation to run. This usually takes my computer about 10 minutes. After the simulation has run, the summary will appear in the command window, and the plots will be generated.
