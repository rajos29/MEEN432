Project 1 — Directions

Run it:
1. Open MATLAB and cd to this folder.
2. Open run_S1.m (Part 1) or run_S12_part2.m (Part 2).
3. Edit the params at the top to your liking.
4. Press Run (or type run_S1 / run_S12_part2).

Outputs you should see:
Figures for error vs Δt, CPU vs Δt, error vs CPU, and (for sine) the CPU–error contour. Part 1 saves them to your drive!
A CPU/error table in the Command Window.

Quick checks:
Step: steady state speed ≈ A/b.
Sine: errors measured vs RK4 with Δt=0.001.
