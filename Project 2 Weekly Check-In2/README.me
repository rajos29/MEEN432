Project 2 – Week 2 Check-in

Progress Completed

Extended the Week 1 track model by adding lateral dynamic components in Simulink.

Built a Driver Model subsystem to estimate steering angle (δf) based on track error.

Implemented a Lateral Dynamics subsystem that accounts for tire slip and tire forces.

Used this subsystem to calculate lateral velocity (vy) and vehicle heading (ψ).

Added a Transformation/Rotation function to convert heading into global X–Y coordinates.

Implemented continuous plotting with an XY Graph to visualize vehicle motion around the track.

Closed the loop by feeding X, Y, and ψ back to the Driver Model subsystem for path correction.

Verified that the vehicle remains within the 15 m track width, correcting heading through curves and aligning properly on straightaways.

Vehicle motion now shows smooth transitions between straight and curved sections with stable behavior.

How to Run

Open all MATLAB and Simulink files provided (innit.m, gentrack.m, animate.m, and Simulink model).

Run innit.m first to initialize all required parameters.

Run gentrack.m to generate track waypoints and prepare the environment.

Keep the Simulink model open, then execute animate.m to simulate and display the vehicle path.

The XY Graph in Simulink will show the lap progress and vehicle dynamics in real time.
