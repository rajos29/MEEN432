Project 2 â€“ Week 1 Check-In

This repository contains the Week 1 deliverables for Project 2. The goal for this week was to generate a race track in MATLAB and animate a simple vehicle patch following the track path. The track consists of two curved sections, each with a radius of 200 meters, and two straightaways of 900 meters in length. The overall track width is 15 meters. The centerline was plotted as a continuous closed loop beginning and ending at the origin (0,0), avoiding the use of disconnected semicircles and lines. A rectangular patch was implemented to represent the vehicle, which rotates appropriately while navigating through curves and re-aligns on straightaways. The animation confirms that the patch follows the waypoints of the centerline smoothly.

How to run:

Open make_track.m.

Open simulink_w1.

Run make_track.m.

The car animation will appear.
